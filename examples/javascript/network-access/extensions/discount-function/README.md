A Shopify Discount Function that implements network connectivity to retrieve data from external services for discount calculations. Through its fetch operations, it sends discount code data to an external API endpoint and receives discount operations in response. The operations received from the external API are then applied, enabling integration with existing promotion systems or third-party discount logic.
