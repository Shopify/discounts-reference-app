This example implements a Shopify UI extension that provides a React-based interface for merchants to configure discount metafields. It uses the admin.discount-details.function-settings.render extension target to create a configuration card in the discount details page.

# Block Extension

Admin block extensions enable app developers to build custom functionality into the context of Shopify Admin. This discount details block surfaces as a card in the discount details page using the "admin.discount-details.function-settings.render" extension block target and allows merchants to configure Discount Function metafields. Developers can build the content of this extension using Shopify's UI Extension components.
