A Shopify Discount Function that reads its configuration from a discount metafield, enabling merchant-configurable promotions. The Function parses the metafield JSON to retrieve product discount percentage, order discount percentage, eligible collection IDs and shipping discount percentage. It can selectively apply percentage discounts to products within specified collections and/or offer a separate percentage discount on the entire order or apply a shipping discount, with all values configurable through the metafield.
