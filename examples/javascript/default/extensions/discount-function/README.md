A Shopify Discount Function offers, product, order and shipping discounts. When order discounts are enabled, it applies a 10% percentage discount to the entire order subtotal. When product discounts are enabled, it applies a 20% discount specifically to the most expensive item in the cart. When shipping discounts are enabled, it makes delivery options free by applying a 100% discount.
